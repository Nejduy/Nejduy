_At the beginning of 2021, I integrated a distance training course to acquire new computer skills._
_Computer training : Commissioning digital equipment, Intervening on infrastructure elements, Assisting or troubleshooting users, developing/programming, learning & sharing_

"first-one"
===========
is building my first website project.

To validate my final exam, I will work on several practical experiences. One of them could be the creation of a small application related to my current job.


👀 At the moment I am learning:
--------------------------------
* Computer basics
* Html
* Css
* And after, javascript

In order to get to know the basics of REACT in the end and to be able to develop my project in it.


🏗️ Example of the current basic codes of my website
--------------------------------------------------------
1. HTML example: `<div class = "aside"> <aside> <img src = "imag ... /> </aside>`
2. CSS example: `div {font-size: large; font weight: oblique; font weight: bold; text-align: right;}`

## > 💻 see you soon and look forward to discussing with you !!! 🤘
